# Completing Your First Pull Request (PR)

## Introduction
We will be following what is called [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development). This means that everytime you make a change to your code and commit and push the changes it will modify the main code base. The benefit of this for this course it that it will simplify your development process. It is also current industry best practice for [continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/). The previous best practice was [Git WorkFlows](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) which involved working off a branch from trunk and merging changes back to trunk after the change was complete. In organisations with many developers working on the same codebase this can result in merge hell where trunk has changed 1 or more times since you branch was made and you need to deal with merge conflicts.
