## :boom: Success Criteria
At the end of this lesson you should:
- Have an account with github and have it linked to the github classroom
- Checked out your first repository
  - Created a new markdown file and noted which of the topics below you have read
  - Committed your changes and created a pull request by following the trunk-based development workflow

**Extensions**
- Update your profile and also add a [README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme), ensuring that you do not include personally identifiable information.
  - Don't use you full name, email address, personal address, phone numbers, photo or anything else that could be tracked to you directly.
  - You can create an avatar that would represent you, just like in the game [Ready Player One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film))
- Go to your user dashboard and create a new repository. Experiment with the features within that repository to familiarize yourself with them.
